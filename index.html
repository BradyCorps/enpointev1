					<div class="article-base-text-wrapper">
						<div class="col-1-sm col-2-md col-3-lg col-4xl">
							<p>
								Enpointe. went behind the scenes for a quick chat with the RWB's
								new Principal artists: Chenin Liu, Yue Shi and Alanna McAdie.
							</p>
							<h2>Chenxin Liu - Principal artist</h2>
							<p>
								Born in Chenzhou, Hunan, China, Chenxin Liu trained at the
								Beijing Dance Academy before joining the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
								School’s Aspirant Program. She joined the RWB Company as an
								Apprentice in 2012, promoted to the Corps de Ballet in 2013,
								Second Soloist in 2017 and Soloist in 2018.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>What is the most important trait you have to be successful as
									an artist?</b
								><br />

								“I think it’s confidence, and I do as best as I can.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>Describe the best performance you’ve ever put on. What did
									you learn from it?</b
								><br />

								“I had a really good performance called La Bayadere, which I
								remember was my last show. There were some movements that
								surprised me, that show was much better than the regular
								rehearsal. I learned everything is possible, just trust my
								body.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What is the best thing about your work?</b><br />
								“Dance makes me happy, I love my job.”
							</p>
							<h2>Yue Shi – Principal artist</h2>
							<p>
								Born in China, Shi began studying ballet at the Liaoning Ballet
								School at the age of 10. Throughout his training, he has
								participated in many international ballet competitions and
								garnered several awards. Shi was invited to join the RWB School
								Aspirant Program when he competed at the Jackson International
								Ballet Competition.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>Where were you when offered the opportunity to become a
									Principal artist? Whom did you share the news with first? How
									did you celebrate?</b
								><br />

								“I was in the studio (410) and our manager told me that I had a
								meeting with
								<a
									href="https://www.rwb.org/who-we-are/people/andre-lewis/"
									target="_blank"
									>André Lewis</a
								>
								and
								<a
									href="https://www.rwb.org/who-we-are/people/tara-birtwhistle/"
									target="_blank"
									>Tara Birtwhistle</a
								>
								... in that meeting André and Tara told me I was being promoted
								to Principal. I was super happy and shared this news to my
								family. I celebrated at home with Chenxin, we made a nice dinner
								together.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>How do you stay strong and fit (mentally and physically) to
									perform at your peak? </b
								><br />

								“Try to practice more and take all the suggestions from the
								artists.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What are three things about Winnipeg that you love?</b><br />

								“Dance, Snow, Hangout with friends ”
							</p>
							<h2>Alanna McAdie - Principal artist</h2>
							<p>
								Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Alanna McAdie trained at the Edmonton
								School of Ballet before beginning her professional training with
								the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School Professional Division. After
								graduating in 2009, she joined RWB’s Aspirant Program before
								becoming a Company Apprentice in 2011. McAdie was promoted to
								Second Soloist in 2015 and First Soloist in 2017.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>How do you stay strong and fit (mentally and physically) to
									perform at your peak? </b
								><br />

								“Consistency is really important - going through the material
								and building stamina at a good steady pace. Knowing how
								physically demanding something will be on stage gives me the
								guidelines for how much time it takes to get there. Mentally I
								find it it’s important to just approach everything with a really
								open mind.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>Have you ever forgotten the dance steps during a performance?
									What happened? </b
								><br />

								“One time on tour for Wizard of Oz, we had a double show day and
								I had performed Dorothy earlier that day…I could tell I was
								mentally tired but of course you have to tell yourself it’s
								going to be OK. It was an extremely fast technical trio called
								Curlycues and we come flying out of the wing and I just blanked.
								I think I just kept my feet and arms going and at some point,
								got back on track. I suspect what felt like ages in my head was
								only a few seconds. It was a scary moment and probably a
								dancer’s greatest fear.”
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>First thing that comes to your mind when you think about the
									RWB?</b
								><br />

								“Resilience”

						<h1>Nutcracker Magic</h1>
						<p>
							The RWB would like to thank our Premier Sponsor of Nutcracker–

							<b
								><a href="https://wso.ca/" target="_blank"
									>Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra.</a
								></b
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Royal Winnipeg Ballet's Nutcracker is filled with world-class
							artists, sets, choreography, costumes, as well as the iconic
							Tchaikovsky score…and this year, with our full orchestra led by
							Principal Conductor Julian Pellicano. Nutcracker is just the kind
							of holiday entertainment we all need after living with the
							pandemic for 19 months!
						</p>
						<p>
							The RWB's current production, choreographed by Galina Yordanova
							and Nina Menon in 1999, is set in Canada, on Christmas Eve, 1913,
							as 12-year-old Clara dreams of being a ballerina. When her
							nutcracker prince leads her to the magical forest, she becomes the
							tall and graceful dancer of her dreams. December 2021 marks 22
							years since the RWB has performed the Yordanova/Menon version of
							Nutcracker (performed every year on stage other than in 2006 and
							2008 when the show took a hiatus for Peter Pan and in 2020 when
							the RWB presented The Nutcracker Suite during the pandemic – a
							digital version of the ballet).
						</p>
						<p>
							Between watching toys come to life, the Sugar Plum Fairy spreading
							her magic, and the villainous Mouse King trying to steal Clara's
							nutcracker, lovingly portrayed by 40 professional artists, and 30
							students, this show will satisfy your vivid imagination while
							leave you wanting more. It is pure escapism at its best. And the
							Canadian elements cannot be missed – from a hockey game and
							Mounties on horseback, to the Hudson’s Bay blanket. Coupled with
							Filbert, the dessert-stealing bear and a host of other characters,
							this two hour extravaganza, with one intermission, will fly by.
						</p>
						<p>
							The biggest draw comes in seeing the RWB’s Company of artists.
							Their precision and elegance is something to behold – simply
							magical. Highlights include the Grand Pas, performed exquisitely
							on opening night by Chenxin and Yue Shi, and the Chinese dance
							performed beautifully by Alanna McAdie and Liam Caines. The
							Arabian dance from Katie Bonnell and Stephen Azulay is nothing
							less than mesmerizing, and it must be said that Liam Caines brings
							a wonderfully skilled and joyful performance to the role of
							Drosselmeier.
						</p>

						<h2>What do you love most about performing <i>Nutcracker</i></h2>
						<h3>Chenxin Liu</h3>
						<p>
							“I love performing in Nutcracker as I get to do the role of Clara
							every year, it’s a fun and challenging role to work on. Nutcracker
							is a holiday show, when we get to do Nutcracker means Christmas is
							coming.”
						</p>

						<h3>Alanna McAdie</h3>
						<p>
							“I love the familiarity of coming back to it every year. As much
							as it’s a tradition for the audience, it’s a tradition for us to
							come back to these steps each year. Because we do more
							performances of the Nutcracker, there are lots of chances to
							improve on a role and really develop as an artist.”
						</p>
						<h3>Yue Shi</h3>
						<p>
							“I love the Story of the Nutcracker, and I enjoyed dancing to the
							prince of the Nutcracker. It's a challenging role, and I like to
							challenge things. ”
						</p>

						<h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Brian Perchaluk, the scenic designer, was a Gemini Award
									winner before designing the Nutcracker, his first RWB
									production?
								</li>
								<li>
									The RWB’s Wardrobe Department make each costume in-house,
									sewing precious details by hand?
								</li>
								<li>
									Nutcracker has about 35 tutus in the show alone, and it can
									take up to 50 hours to create just one snowflake tutu?
								</li>
								<li>
									To transform the Nutcracker stage into a winter wonderland is
									no small feat. To make Nutcracker happen, 34 stagehands are
									needed for setup while 26 stagehands are staffed for the
									duration of the production.
								</li>
								<li>
									There are 18 fly cues that move 32 pieces of scenery? With the
									final minutes of Nutcracker requiring three major scene
									changes, it is no wonder Nutcracker planning early each year!

								In 1996 the headline was “Capital Campaign Brings Dream of a
								Student Residence to Life” and 25 years later the headline is
								“Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet Expands Illustrious Campus with
								Historic Construction Project.”
								<br />
								The RWB has come a long way.
							</p>
							<p>
								In less than 30 days, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB) will open
								the doors to 225 Edmonton Street, a new home-away-from-home for
								the young artists training in the RWB School Professional
								Division and an expansion of the illustrious RWB studios for all
								dancers. This safe, supportive, and functional environment will
								house both dance education and boarding services, combining
								modern program delivery and long-term operational sustainability
							</p>
							<p>
								This five-level contemporary facility is built on top of the
								existing RWB parkade and connects to the RWB studios through an
								enclose and secure passageway. It includes dance and fitness
								studios, classrooms, recreation and relaxation spaces, an
								outdoor greenspace, and expanded food service program, and more
								– all in the spirit of balancing professional training with
								livability and student comfort.
							</p>
							<p>
								The design and construction process was overseen by RWB School
								Director Stéphane Léonard: “Providing aspiring dancers with a
								brand-new place to learn and grow that was specifically designed
								for them is incredible! As the world changes, we must change
								with it. Today’s best practices with respect to child safety and
								child development were the driving forces in the design
								exercise, which I know will be a comfort to student families
								making the sometimes-difficult decision to send their children
								away from home to pursue their dreams. This is going to be a
								beautiful place where young people from around the world will
								develop their artistry and their characters and cultivate
								friendships that will last a lifetime.”
							</p>
							<p>
								This $15 million project and signature building is the result of
								a joint effort between the RWB and True North Real Estate
								Development, designed by Architecture49 and built by PCL
								Construction. The RWB is grateful to the countless individuals
								who contributed to the original student residence and elevated
								the training for young artists around the world and it is also
								grateful to the organizations and the many supporters for
								helping make this new vision a reality.
							</p>
							<p>
								Auditions are underway across the country so the RWB is
								appealing to all potential dancers to seize the opportunity to
								live and train in a state-of-the-art complex, guided by a highly
								professional faculty. Students can virtually audition from
								anywhere in the country and those who unable to attend may send
								in a video application, which will be accepted until May 1,
								2022. Following the audition process, students recognized as
								having potential for professional training are invited to attend
								Summer Session. Throughout the month of July 2022 in Winnipeg,
								Summer Session allows students to experience life at the RWB
								firsthand. Students who are a fit for one of the RWB School’s
								professional programs will be accepted into Regular Session,
								which runs from September 2022 to June 2023. Check out
								rwb.org/auditions for more details.
							</p>
							<p>
								Alanna McAdie, a 2009 Ballet Academic Program graduate, Aspirant
								Program alumna, and Principal Company artist sums it up well:
								"The beauty of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet is in our integration.
								We have many studios, and they are always being shared between
								School and Company. The ability to witness Company dancers
								working every day helped me see my goals as a student, and the
								teachers at the RWB School helped me achieve those dreams. Every
								teacher pours their hearts into their work and every student
								matters. I am very grateful for the training I received at the
								RWB School.
							</p>
							<p>
								The audition tour has been made possible in part by the
								Government of Canada and the Manitoba Arts Council. The RWB also
								recognizes IG Wealth Management as the presenting sponsor of
								auditions and for providing scholarships for one student from
								every province to attend Summer Session each year.

								Sydney Mangilit is synonymous with the heart of dance. It’s in

								Royal Dance at the Forks. Around the age of 8, Sydney and
								friends decided to move to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet for ballet
								classes in the Recreational Division. She began level 2 ballet
								with Nicole Kepp and Beginner 8-11 Tap with Aimee Brasko.
							</p>
							<p>
								The following year Sydney did level 3 Ballet with Nicole Kepp,
								level 4 Tap and Junior Tap Ensemble with Aimee Brasko. The
								ensemble program is by invitation only. Sydney may have been
								intimidated at first as she was the “new kid on the block”,
								however she fit right in and ended up dancing with this group
								for years. They competed at Extreme Dance (Sydney’s first dance
								competition and convention ever), Manitoba Dance Festival and
								the RWB’s Ballet in the Park.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sydney moved on to Level 4 Ballet with Suzanne André and Level 5
								Tap and Junior Tap Dance Ensemble with Aimee Brasko. Next up was
								Ballet Level 5A with Rachelle Vermette and Tap Level 6 with
								Aimee Brasko. Meanwhile in school, she played clarinet in band
								class, ran track, joined the photography club and the school
								leadership program.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now in Grade 8, Sydney joined Ballet Level 5B with Nicole Kepp.
								She also did Pointe Level 5B with Rachelle Vermette, Teen Jazz
								with Kira Kjear, Tap Level 7A/B and Intermediate Tap Dance
								Ensemble with Aimee Brasko. She returned to Ensemble too. The
								piece for the year was called, “Shout!” and the group performed
								it at the RWB’s Ballet in the Park.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sydney moved on to Level 6A with Marijka Stanowych, Level 5B
								Pointe with Jacqui Ladwig as well as Level 8 Tap and Senior Tap
								Dance Ensemble with Darilyn Burdeniuk. The piece that year was
								called, “Pause”, and is one of Sydney’s favourites to perform to
								this day. Meanwhile, she enrolled in Sisler High School’s
								accelerated program, earned the WISE (Women in Science and
								Engineering) award and finished on the Honour Roll.
							</p>
							<p>
								In grade 10, Sydney took Level 6B Ballet with Katrin Benedictson
								and Marijka Stanowych, Pointe Level 6/7 with Jacqui Ladwig as
								well as Tap Level 8B and Senior Tap Dance Ensemble with Darilyn
								Burdeniuk. Sydney continued to excel in school and danced on
								Sisler’s Most Wanted team.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the RWB, Sydney completed Level 6B/7A Ballet with Katrin
								Benedictson and Marijka Stanowych as well as Level 8B Tap and
								Senior Tap Dance Ensemble with Darilyn Burdeniuk. By this time,
								Sydney had developed many friendships at the RWB and the group
								would often come straight to the Ballet after school, sit at the
								same tables, as well as eat early dinners and do homework
								together before class.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Grade 12, Sydney completed Ballet Level 7B/8 with Katrin
								Benedictson and in school was the Grad committee co-chair,
								picked up weightlifting and again finished on the honour roll,
								receiving University entrance scholarships.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sydney is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering, majoring
								in Chemical Engineering at Ryerson University. She hopes to work
								in cosmetics upon graduating. She is also working at the RWB as
								an assistant in School administration. She took an Adult Summer
								Dance this past summer and is taking hip hop now (and says “it’s
								awesome”)! Early on, Sydney has learned the art of balance and
								managing competing priorities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sydney Mangilit is an exceptional young woman with a bright
								future. Dance is part of who she has become. She doesn’t need
								wings to fly, as Sydney has a heart that flies for dance and for
								life. She is passionate about dance and her overall passion is
								also reflected in her academic, professional and personal growth
								and success. The RWB’s Recreational Division has so much to
								offer to young people and people of all ages – and it’s fun at
								the same time. Just ask Sydney!

					<h1>"Going Home Star" Journey</h1>
					<div class="article-base-text-wrapper">
						<div class="col-1-sm col-2-md col-3-lg col-4-xl">
							<p>
								This EN POINTE. story is designed as a 3-part series revolving
								around the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s
								<i>“Going Home Star”</i> journey. Part 1 focuses on the
								beginnings - the commissioning of Going Home Star – Truth and
								Reconciliation, the signing of the City of Winnipeg’s Accord and
								the RWB’s ongoing commitment; Part 2 will speak to the RWB’s
								invaluable relationships and activities with helpers, knowledge
								workers and elders Barbara Bruce and Charlotte Nolin, as well as
								the RWB’s Indigenous Advisory Circle members, Kevin Lamoureux,
								Tara Letwiniuk, Albert McLeod and Danielle Morrison; and Part 3
								will come full circle and weave in the voices and sentiments of
								Jamie Deleau, Company artist, Kate Fennell, Managing Director of
								the RWB School, David Warburton, Company Managing Director, Tara
								Birtwhistle, Associate Artistic Director, and André Lewis,
								Artistic Director & CEO, all of whom have been pivotal leaders
								in the RWB organization journey.
							</p>
							<h2>Part 1</h2>
							<p>
								<i>Going Home Star</i> was first envisioned by the late Cree
								elder and activist Mary Richard and André Lewis. Multi-talented
								Tina Keeper and some of Canada’s top artistic talents, including
								acclaimed choreographer Mark Godden, esteemed Métis scenic
								designer KC Adams and Juno Award-winning composer Christos
								Hatzis joined the top-notch team. The late Ted Fontaine, former
								chief of the Sagkeeng Ojibway First Nation in Manitoba was also
								a key player; Fontaine maintained the ballet helped his own
								healing and that it was a positive experience to see this
								performance. The ballet also featured the music of Inuk throat
								singer Tanya Tagaq and Steve Wood and the Northern Cree Singers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commissioned by André Lewis, <i>Going Home Star</i> is a
								representation of the emotions and experiences both told and
								untold by residential school survivors and their families.
								“Through <i>Going Home Star - Truth and Reconciliation</i>, we
								had the opportunity to share residential school stories and the
								spirit of reconciliation with a wider audience; however, to this
								day, we recognize there is much to be done to strengthen our
								relationship with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people and we
								are eager to take those steps,” said RWB Artistic Director and
								CEO André Lewis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fast forwarding to June 2018, the RWB joined over one hundred
								organizations, as partners, in signing the City of Winnipeg’s
								Indigenous Accord, an endeavour in accordance with the Truth and
								Reconciliation calls to action. It also sought to build
								partnerships with community elders and collaborate with
								Indigenous and Non-Indigenous artists to set commitments and
								take meaningful actions.
							</p>
							<p>
								When Mary Richard passed away several years ago, the RWB lost a
								dear friend and mentor; the same was true when Ted Fontaine
								passed away in May 2021. Both were important inspirations on the
								RWB journey. Fontaine was also instrumental in educating Company
								artists and staff about his personal experience as a residential
								school survivor; he joined the RWB for rehearsals of the
								production; he was influential in facilitating how artists told
								the story. His influence helped to transform the RWB
								organization – from cultural awareness training, sweat lodges
								and smudging, to pipe ceremonies, traditional feasting and the
								formation of the RWB Indigenous Advisory Circle.
							</p>
							<p>
								The challenge for the RWB was how to translate
								<i>Going Home Star</i>
								and its commitment to truth and reconciliation into a new way of
								doing things throughout the organization. Stay tuned for Part 2
								In January 2022.
